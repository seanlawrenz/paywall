# NYT article fetcher

Get articles from your favorite paywall newspaper.

Keep this to yourself. We don't want the man getting involed.

## Installing

To install clone this repo and run:

```
yarn
cd ./client
yarn
cd ../server
yarn
cd ../
```

## Running

```
yarn start
```

This should start the server and client and go to http://localhost:3000/

## Run tests

```
cd ./client
yarn test
```

## Add to this

It would be nice to get other papers (like the dispatch) as well.
Just make a pull request.
